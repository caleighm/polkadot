# Hello!

This is a sweet little app for home daycare providers. Still under development.

(Why do the early commits say "Steam Deck User"? I'm doing this on my Steam Deck.)

(Why am I doing this on my Steam Deck? I don't want to buy a new laptop when the Steam Deck's Desktop mode is pretty sweet.)

(What's it like developing for Android on a Steam Deck? Surprisingly not too bad, but I can hear the Deck chugging away whenever I try to run the emulator...)
